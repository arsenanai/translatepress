- get initial default locale
- get WP language codes
- missing (page-slug) description in editor for some php versions
- add language directly published to avoid confusion
- hreflang should only output the published languages not all the translation-languages
- add custom url slugs
- make wp->google language code mapping
- in editor clicking on a link without language information will not change the Editor language back to Default (editor does not take into account language from url)
-i changing language in editor fast ( before loading the preview page ), goes undefined in url
- changing language from floater in editor, not working
- add no translate on admin bar
- no translate class on language switchers around the world

 BUGS
-------

-i custom template does not redirect to default language, even in normal page view.

- 404 when page slug is translated with permalinks set to post name
- indexof js error on edit profile page
- () empty paranthesis on dynamicly translated strings
- img src gets translated when it shouldn't. see flags.
- see if images can get selected in editor


-----------
 Big To Do
-----------
-i shortcode should take into account short-name, full-name, flags
- default language should have optional encoding in url
- current language in menu (language-switcher cpt)
- force custom links option
- edit this in admin bar
- string translation table
- when only 1 or 2 languages, in editor looks weird
- free version
- edd update class
- multisite
- challenges:
  - paged pages, user listing
  - support for translating emails
  - caching plugins



-------------
 Small To Do
-------------
-i editor pencil icon has white background
-i highlighting should be done with css, and with a nice colour (editor js line 473)
- isset peste toate setarile url-slugs si altele. incearca pluginul fara "settings" din db

- cookie language
- add no translate on scripts
- saved! appears when navigating editor
- responsive settings page on small width //
- translate dynamic added strings //
- add number of strings in category Text(6) Meta (3) //
- check for //TODO remove this when finished
- make sure current_user_can checks are on point //
- make sure the language exists in the settings when get_translations //
- different charset collation for each language? //
- common factor when initializing pro and free components. //
- make sure page title is translated auto, and manually //
- remove already selected languages from selects in settings //
- unpublished languages can be reached at url
- rename plugin directory to translatepress without dash

IDEAS

- opening editor closes back to where editor was started
- if wp back-end language is changed to the translation language, the editor should recognize the already translated strings
 from the theme and plugins and set them as already translated, in our dictionary.
